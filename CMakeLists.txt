### CUSTOMIZATION STEPS
# 1. Change the argument to project() with the name of your library/package
#    (it will be the one used for find_package() call)
# 2. Change version information
# 3. Add your library source files in the subdirectories
#    - src/"LibName"/include
#    - src/"LibName"/src
# 4. Add your executable source files in the subdirectories
#    - src/"ExecName"
# 5. Update src/CMakeLists.txt
# 6. Add the tests to your library in /test subdirectory and modify
#    test/CMakeLists.txt accordingly.

# This sets the PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_VERSION as well as other variable
# listed here: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html.
# We use this name to export all the files such that is then possible to use
# find_package(LibTemplateCMake) in third party projects.
# LANGUAGES specifies which languages your project supports. To have a broad
# support with external libraries, it is good practice to list both CXX and C.
# Infact, some legacy Find<package>.cmake files that require the C language to
# be enabled and thus using only CXX may cause issues. Note that by default when
# LANGUAGES is not specified CMake enables both CXX and C.

# This is particularly useful to run ctests on libraries built on Windows
# machines: tests, which are executables, are placed in the same folders of
# dlls, which are treated as executables as well, so that they can properly
# find the libraries to run. This is a because of missing RPATH on Windows.

# Build position independent code.
# Position Independent Code (PIC) is commonly used for shared libraries so that
# the same shared library code can be loaded in each program address space in a
# location where it will not overlap with any other uses of such memory.
# In particular, this option avoids problems occurring when a process wants to
# load more than one shared library at the same virtual address.
# Since shared libraries cannot predict where other shared libraries could be
# loaded, this is an unavoidable problem with the traditional shared library
# concept.
# Generating position-independent code is often the default behavior for most
# modern compilers.
# Moreover linking a static library that is not built with PIC from a shared
# library will fail on some compiler/architecture combinations.
# Further details on PIC can be found here:

# Create and install CMake configuration files for your project that are
# necessary to for other projects to call find_package(LibTemplateCMake).
#
# Note that it is extremely important to use exactly the project name while
# installing configuration files (you can use PROJECT_NAME variable to avoid
# any possible error). This is required to allow find_package() to properly
# look for the installed library in system path, in particular in Windows when
# the installation is performed in the default path.
#
# install_basic_package_files() comes with many input parameters to customize
# the configuration files. The parameters used in the following call provide
# basic versions of CMake configuration files.
# See install_basic_package_files() documentation found in ./cmake folder.
#
# Note that if your library depends from other libraries, you are probably
# required to used the install_basic_package_files() DEPENDENCIES option.
